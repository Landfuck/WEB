  <p>RESIDENCY
  <br>collaboration with koło gospodyń wiejskich
april 2024</p>
  
     <p>
    During the residency, I chose to collaborate with a local "housewife club" 
(Koło Gospodyń Wiejskich), along with a few mothers and their children. 
My intention wasn’t necessarily to produce work for exhibition, 
but rather to create a space where we could enjoy ourselves, 
experiment, and explore hidden corners of our creativity.

Together, we engaged in playful exercises—drawing while blindfolded, 
action painting on a large 3×4 meter canvas, and attempting to capture the 
shapes and colors of things we couldn’t see. The outcomes were meant to 
be light-hearted and joyful. Through this process, 
I hoped to show that creativity is for everyone, 
and that it can help us release, connect, and simply be present.
