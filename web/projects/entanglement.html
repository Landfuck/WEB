        These drawings/paintings, created from the remnants of a burned forest
        in České Švýcarsko (i used mortar and pest), 
        reflect the transformation and restoration of the landscape.

The Entanglement exhibition is a collaborative effort by three
like-minded organizations: Culture for Future, Artmat, and Artbiom. The exhibition’s title loosely references the ideas of philosopher Donna Haraway, who argues in her book Staying with
the Trouble that all entities on Earth are inherently connected
or intertwined with others. Haraway suggests that human behavior influences all beings on the planet, and that addressing
the ecological crisis requires shifting our focus from individuality and human autonomy to the interconnectedness and mutual relationships of all life forms. We are, as she posits, always
inseparably and reciprocally linked with our environment.
The exhibition, featuring a diverse and intergenerational
group of creators, provides perspectives on ecosystems from
both global and local viewpoints. Alongside global issues, the
showcased projects highlight specific places and their transformations. The artistic works are created in collaboration with
scientific expertise, fostering natural intersections of disciplines
and mutual enrichment. They primarily explore themes related to water, forests, fire, vegetation, fungi, and bees—systems
and entities that, although often overlooked in our daily lives,
profoundly impact life on Earth.
