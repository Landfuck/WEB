      <p>The map opens up to the pedestrian like a mountain on a Friday. Unfold it on the moss surrounding
        the table-shaped stone, and suddenly you aren’t sure what’s south and what’s north.
        Examine the map carefully, look for similarities in the landscape. A broken branch partially
        covered in the sand, or animal tracks leading to a watering hole. The map is looking back at
        you, too. It looks at your north side, covered in lichen, and your delicate fingers, like
        trichopteran’s or bullheads. You’re suddenly not sure where it begins and where it ends. You
        just look through two pairs of eyes, blinking sleepily at each other.</p>

        The large-scale prints are installed in the Vltavská area and its immediate surroundings. It is possible to
enter the cubes carrying the maps, and the landscape below the map, accessible to a different way of
reading, opens up to the visitors. The prints are inspired by the history of Holešovice, its expanding development, as well as the colors of Vltavská and the Bubny area. The map grows like a living organism, flows
through the Vltava riverbed covered in sand, and emerges from its plastron like a turtle. The installation
features a Czech and English soundtrack telling the story of those who read the maps like their bodies.
They are exploring the properties of space, trying to find their way and grasp themselves. Voices echo
through the deserted space that disappears under a layer of new plans, sounds and neighborhoods.<br>
