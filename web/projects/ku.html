  KU (6:52’) draws inspiration from an intriguing tale of an extraordinary fruit, resembling a fish, soaring like a bird, and exclusive to Khazaria. This narrative originates from Milorad Pavic’s renowned work, the Dictionary of Khazars. The film delves into a dialogue between two creatures, contemplating the enigmatic
  nature of this fruit. It prompts reflections on their identity and the identity of the elusive fruit, as these small beings grapple with understanding the world
  around them. The video has been showcased at various venues, including Gallery Mihhaile in Estonia, the Famufest exhibition in Prague, and screenings in San
  Francisco’s Ponrepo, among others.
