        Water is site specific sound performance, designed for a monastery at Plasy, shown at festival on Architecture and Sound (Agosto Foundation). Monastery itself
in build on a water (By famous Architect Santini): that creates necessity of a stable water level - otherwise the foundations rots and monastery falls down. We
have performed a ritual of bringing water and visitors was able to hear the sound of it as it was poured into the pond inside one of the buildings. Sound was
recorded and transformed into composition dealing with space, motion and surface. It was held as a tribute to water as element of a life in architectonical sense,
as the building alike life is based on it. This performace was done in collaboration with Zuzana Sklibova and Matej Senkyrik.
