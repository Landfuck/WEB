       <i>  Wetlands that house sandpipers, grouse, sundews, bladderworts, and both red and ragged sphagnum
mosses are quickly disappearing. The landscape is changing, just like the walks I take. Sometimes I find
myself sitting on the porch, imagining turning around a boulder and heading uphill. Beyond the alders,
where the meadow turns into a wetland, I have a snack and spend the whole afternoon looking for
sundews. These imaginary walks are becoming more frequent. The world I venture into is increasingly
different from the one I know when I look out the window. The wetland merges with the jungle, and
wild hyphae grow on the slope among the thistles. These imaginary endemics are captured on canvas as
microorganisms that could also be landscapes.</i>
