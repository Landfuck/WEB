        This project revolves around the experimental novel, “Eels for Muriel,” a narrative that blurs the boundaries between fiction and reality, diving into the complexities of identity in a world teetering on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The protagonist, Muriel, and the narrator navigate a universe of uncertainty, trauma, and the constant struggle for meaning amidst the disintegration of familiar structures. The novel extends beyond traditional boundaries, manifesting in visual art practices, exhibitions, performances, and sound events. The residency aims to further develop this project by collaborating with fellow artists
        and researchers. Tasks will involve creating collages from collective research, exploring narratives during field trips, and imbuing found objects with contextual
        or decontextualized meaning.
        Embracing ambiguity is a key theme, where identity is explored not through alignment with specific goals and traits but through a lack of identification,
        even in the face of existential moments. The project will utilize the seashore, its fauna, sea salt, and fungi to create small objects acting as catalysts for storytelling. Theoretical underpinnings draw inspiration from Gilles Deleuze’s concepts of virtuality and actuality, challenging conventional notions of accessing
        the past. Additionally, Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s synthesis of senses and communication structures informs the exploration of the intrinsic ambiguity in understanding oneself and the world.
        The project aims to extend this theoretical exploration into the infrastructure of nature, investigating its memory, our part in it, and exploring its narrative
        skills from a phenomenological perspective. Can we communicate with the forest in a manner similar to other living entities, given our evolving awareness of
        their responses to environmental changes and human impact?
        In essence, this project seeks to unravel the layers of ambiguity in identity and nature, transcending traditional storytelling boundaries and engaging with the
        world in a manner that goes beyond the tangible.

This is just a GPT image creation trying to picture Muriel
according to my desription.
Next few pages are connected with this project
in a simiplar playfull way
of eploration this “book“
throught various medias and
materials.
<br><br>
These illustrations were created as an exploration of the sea near the house where
Muriel lives, depicting possible creatures
and plants she encounters. It’s more or
less a game I played with myself, trying to
see the landscape through the eyes of my
character.
<br><br>
Collages with automatic writing.
I imagined Muriel, then I focused on how
much I miss her, and I wrote about it.
Some parts were covered with memories
of colors, some were too painful to show.
This is the result. Another exploration of my
character and what my relation to her is.
<br><br>
Another physical exploration of a book. On
the right, there might be little salty creatures Muriel found on a beach one morning. Just under these, there are sand dunes
with mud, coral reefs, and water ponds
near the house Muriel stays this summer.
